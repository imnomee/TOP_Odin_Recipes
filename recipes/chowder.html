        <p>
            Looking for a turkey and potato soup recipe to use up that leftover
            holiday turkey? Try this rich and creamy homemade chowder that's

        <p>
            A touch of Sriracha added just before serving adds a subtle kick,
            but if you're concerned about it being too spicy, just leave it out
            â€” you'll still love this delicious soup! It's ready in just 35
            minutes and will soar to the top of your family's favorite soup
            list. Serve with oyster crackers or slices of crusty bread.
